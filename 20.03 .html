<p style="font-style:oblique; font-weight:bold; font-size:20px; font-variant:normal;">Doraemon is my favorite cartoon show. He's a cat robot who has superpowers.
<br>He lives at nobita's house. ...
<br>He always gets himself in trouble, and whenever he's in trouble, Doraemon will be there to help him. ...
<br>Nobita has several adversaries, too, Suniyo and Jian. ...
<br>Doraemon always comes to help him

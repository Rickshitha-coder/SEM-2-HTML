<b  style="color:PaleGreen;">Birth Story and Origin of Lord Murugan:</b><br>In one of the incarnations of Parvati, she was born in the family of Himaavan the king of the mountains, and performed a severe penance to once again reach the adobe of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was very much pleased by her and married her, then he took her to a place called Gandamadhana parvat to live their life.
When Lord Shiva was engaged in deep meditation while Parvati was serving him with all devotion and deity, An asura called Surapadma captured all the gods and imprisoned them so that heaven could remain empty and the demons rule the three worlds. 
The gods in captivity were tortured by the demons. The reason for this horror is due to the curse that fell upon the deities during their participation in the sacrifice led by Daksha, father of Goddess Parvati in her incarnation as Sati. It is also said that Lord Shiva was not invited to this sacrifice, since Daksha was a reverent acolyte of Lord Vishnu and hated Lord Vishnu. 
The imprisoned gods finally got exhausted and prayed to Lord Brahma and Vishnu to do something to stop the imprisonment. They both stated that the boon the demons got could not be killed by powers other than lord shiva. So Shiva and Parvathi needed to give birth to a child. 
So Shiva needs to attract Parvathi to give birth to a child since Shiva was engaged in deep meditation something has to be done to get him attracted to Parvathi. They landed on a strange idea by approaching Manmata to distract Shiva by releasing an arrow of love from Manmatas blow towards Lord Shiva.  
This instance caused disturbance to Lord Shiva, Angered Lord Shiva opened his third eye and made Manmata into ashes by the fire that came forth from the eye. 
All the gods prayed to Lord Shiva as they planned to request Manmata to distract him. By understanding the truth Lord Shiva gave back life to Manmata with a curse that he shall remain invisible. 
The six flames that burnt down Manmata are now carried by Agni to Saravana Lake and formed as six charming children that are taken care of by six Karthika sisters. Once Shiva and Parvathi visited the lake, Mother Parvathi embraced all six children together and they became one child with six faces namely Eesanam, Tathpurusham, Vamadevam, Agoram, Sathyojatham, and Adhomugam. 
The child is called as Shanmuga, Muruga, Subramanya, Kanda, Karthikeya, and many more. Mother Parvathi gifted the boy Muruga with a spear and the boy went to fight with the demon surapadma and cut the demon into two pieces. After the defeat, the demon prayed that he wanted to be accommodated with Muruga, So Muruga made the two pieces of the body into a peacock and a cock. 
The cock found a place on the flag and the peacock became his vehicle. Thus Lord Muruga was born and got immortal fame and numerous temples were built for him.
